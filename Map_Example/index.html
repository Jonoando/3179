      <h3>Industry Insight</h3>
      <p>
        Victoria was the largest wine producing state for a long time until South Australia 
        overtook it from the late 2010's. New South Wales has consitently maintian 3rd spot. 
        Despite year to year variations, the number of producers has remained relatively 
        stable over recent years, showing that supply has most likely caught up with demand
        as well as a mature and well established wine industry.

      <h3>Consumption Trend</h3>
      <p>
        Alcohol consumption in Australia peaked in the mid 1970s at over 13 litres per person,
        driven largely by beer. Since then, overall consumption has gradually declined.
        However, wine consumption has shown a steady upward trend, highlighting a shift
        in preferences toward wine despite reduced total alcohol intake. Itâ€™s also important
        to note that wine has a higher alcohol content than beer, so an equal change in litres
        represents a different relative change in drinking behaviour, suggesting that even 
        modest increases in wine consumption can contribute more significantly to total alcohol 
        intake.
