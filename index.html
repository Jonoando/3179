        <h3>Industry Insight</h3>
        <p>
          Victoria was the largest wine producing state for a long time until South Australia
          overtook it in the late 2010s. New South Wales has consistently maintained 3rd spot.
          Despite year to year variations, the number of producers has remained relatively stable,
          suggesting a mature and well established wine industry.
          <em> Note: ACT and NSW were combined in this visualisation.</em>

        <h3>Consumption Trend</h3>
        <p>
          Alcohol consumption in Australia peaked in the mid 1970s at over 13 litres per person,
          driven largely by beer. Since then, overall consumption has gradually declined.
          However, wine consumption has shown a steady upward trend, highlighting a shift
          towards wine despite reduced total alcohol intake. Wine also has a higher ABV
          (Alcohol by Volume) meaning the same direct change in consumption between Beer and
          Wine is not relative as there is a greater ABV change with wine.

      <h3>Global Wine Industry Analysis (2000–2024)</h3>
      <p>
        The global wine trade is stable and dominated by established producers.
        <strong>New Zealand</strong> leads exports per capita in recent years taking the crown
        from France in 2008. this reflects a premium, export oriented approach despite it's 
        modest volume. France and Italy remain strong followers with Australia dropping
        from 2nd to 7-9th in the rankings.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the import side, smaller higher income markets such as <strong>Switzerland, Belgium–Luxembourg,
        Denmark, and Hong Kong</strong> regularly top the per capita spend, indicating their demand for
        purchasing premium wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        For production per capita, <strong>Italy, Spain, and Portugal</strong> consistently rank
        highly, with steady appearances from <strong>Chile, Georgia, Moldova, France, Australia 
        and New Zealand</strong>. This suggests that the major global wine producing regions are 
        well established showing a mature and resilient global market.
