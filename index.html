        <h3>Industry Insight</h3>
        <p>
          Victoria was the largest wine-producing state for a long time until South Australia
          overtook it in the late 2010s. New South Wales has consistently maintained 3rd spot.
          Despite year-to-year variations, the number of producers has remained relatively stable,
          suggesting a mature and well-established wine industry.
          <em>Note: ACT and NSW were combined in this visualisation.</em>

        <h3>Consumption Trend</h3>
        <p>
          Alcohol consumption in Australia peaked in the mid-1970s at over 13 litres per person,
          driven largely by beer. Since then, overall consumption has gradually declined.
          However, wine consumption has shown a steady upward trend, highlighting a shift
          towards wine despite reduced total alcohol intake.
